Home Automation
===============
The purpose of this project is to monitor and control home environment, expecially temperature.

Hardware preparation:
  1. Raspberry Pi
  2. Temperature Sensor. I choose DS18B20
  3. IR Transmitter

Raspberry Pi will monitor and record home temperature in every minute. Use computer or mobile device, you can get current temperature, view temperature history, and control airconditioner remotely.

This project is still ongoing. Features ready until now are:
  1. Monitor and record temperatrue on Raspberry Pi

TODO:
  1. Get current temperature and temperature history on computer
  2. Get current temperature and temperature history on mobile device
  3. Control IR transmitter on Raspberry Pi
  4. Control IR transmitter on computer
  5. Control IR transmitter on mobile device
